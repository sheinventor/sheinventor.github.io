# What is 3D Printing? {data-stack-name="Introduction"}

3D printing is a manufacturing technology that creates objects layer by layer, guided by a digital file processed on a computer before being sent to the machine.  

Unlike other manufacturing methods, it doesn't require molds, making it highly versatile and ideal for prototyping, customization, and small-scale production.

## Main Technologies and Materials

### Common Technology
The most used is **Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)**, where a plastic filament is heated and extruded to form the object's layers.

### Most Common Material: PLA
PLA (Polylactic Acid) is affordable, easy to use, and less toxic than other materials. However, it has limitations:  

- **Not suitable** for constant food contact.  
- **Not recommended** for humid or hot environments.

# PLA Applications {data-name="Applications"}

- Decorative or artistic objects.  
- Prototypes for personal projects.  
- Organizers and everyday accessories.  
- Non-structural spare parts.

# How to 3D Print

The process follows these basic steps:  

1. **Get a 3D model:** Design it using software like Tinkercad, Fusion 360, or Blender, or download it from Thingiverse.  
2. **Prepare the file:** Use a *slicer* program (Cura, PrusaSlicer) to convert the model into G-code, adjusting parameters like temperature and speed.  
3. **Transfer the file:** Send it to the printer via USB, SD, or Wi-Fi.  
4. **Calibrate:** Level the print bed and adjust the nozzle for good adhesion.  
5. **Load the filament:** Ensure itâ€™s dry and properly stored.  
6. **Print and monitor:** Watch the process to catch errors early.

# Common Issues and Solutions

1. **First layer adhesion problems:**  
   - Level and clean the print bed.  
   - Use glue stick or blue tape to improve adhesion.  

2. **Filament jams:**  
   - Clean the extruder regularly.  
   - Avoid using wet filament.  

3. **Layer shifting:**  
   - Ensure belts are tight.  
   - Lubricate the guides.
