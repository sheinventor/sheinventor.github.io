# Starting with the Creality CR-10 V3 {data-stack-name="3DPrinting"}

## Unboxing and Assembly  
1. **Verify the contents**  
   - Check for all necessary parts: frame, base, extruder, cables, and tools.  
   - Assemble the vertical frame and secure it to the base.  
   - Install the Titan extruder and connect all cables firmly.

## 2. **Level the bed**  
   - Preheat the extruder (200°C) and the bed (60°C).  
   - Use a piece of paper to adjust the distance between the nozzle and bed. Ensure slight resistance at each corner and the center.

## Loading Filament  
1. Preheat the nozzle to 200°C.  
2. Cut the filament tip at an angle and insert it into the extruder.  
3. Use the "Load Filament" option on the menu.  
4. Ensure the filament extrudes properly from the nozzle.

## Preparing the Model for Printing  
1. **Get a 3D model**  
   - Download from platforms like [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) in STL format.  

## 

2. **Slice the model**  
   - Use software like Cura.  
   - Choose settings for PLA:  
     - Extruder Temp: 200-210°C  
     - Bed Temp: 60°C  
     - Infill: 20% (standard).  
## 

3. **Save the G-code**  
   - Export the file to a microSD card.  

---

## Printing  
1. Insert the microSD card into the printer.  
2. Select the file from the menu.  
3. Monitor the first few layers to ensure proper adhesion.  
4. Wait for the print to finish.

---

## Removing and Maintaining  
1. Let the bed cool before removing the print.  
2. Store PLA filament in a dry, airtight container with silica gel.  
3. Regularly clean the nozzle and bed.

---

## Troubleshooting  
- Uneven bed: Re-level the bed.  
- Poor adhesion: Adjust the first-layer settings or use an adhesive on the bed.  
- Filament jams: Clean the nozzle or reload the filament.
