There are three steps:

**1) CAD Model ‚Üí 2) 'Slicing' Process ‚Üí 3) `.Gcode` File**
:::
:::

## CAD Model

::: {.callout-tip title="Goal"}
**Obtain the CAD model useful for 3D printing.**
:::

### Obtaining a CAD Model

:::{layout="[40,60]"}

**CAD Software**

It can be designed using 3D modeling software:

- Fusion 360
- Blender
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Onshape**

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/3.webp){width="30%" fig-align="center"}

:::

:::{}
**Model Libraries**

Download models from websites such as:

- [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com)
- [Printables](https://www.printables.com)
- [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com)

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/4.webp){width="30%" fig-align="center"}

### Obtaining a Model ‚Üí Onshape CAD

The goal is to obtain the CAD model in `.STL` file format.

## Slicing Process

::: {.callout-tip title="Goal"}
**Convert the `.STL` model into a `.GCODE` machine file**
:::

### 
This 3D model needs to be converted into a G-Code file, with all the correct printer settings, so we use a compatible slicer like OrcaSlicer.

##

Save the file (G-code format) onto a compatible USB drive.

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/6.webp){width="30%" fig-align="center"}

At LF2L, USB drives are provided next to the printers.

# Check Printer Status

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

Make sure the printer is clean, with no filament residue on the nozzle or the print bed.

:::

:::{}

Clean the print bed with a paper towel and isopropyl alcohol.

:::

# How to Turn On the Printer


## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

Ensure the printer is connected to a power socket.

Press the power button located at the back, then the one at the front.

:::

:::{}
![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/9.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

# How to Load Filament (If No Filament Is Present)

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

Place the filament at the back of the printer.

:::

:::{}
![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/12.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

Open the top door.

:::

:::{}
![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/13.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Place the end of the filament in the white tube and push until it comes out on the other side.

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/14.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

Go to the menu via the touch screen and select the "Filament" option.

Choose the "Change Filament" option.

:::

:::{}
![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/15.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Wait until the temperature reaches 220 ¬∞C 

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/16.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

Insert the filament into the extruder as shown in the image. If done correctly, the printer will detect it and start extruding.

:::

:::{}
![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/17.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## The printer will extrude filament for a while to clean out any remnants of the previous filament.

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/18.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/19.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

:::

:::{}

Remove the printed filament.

:::

# How to Change the Filament (by Removing the Old Filament):

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

Open the top door.

:::

:::{}
![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/20.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## 

Remove the white tube and cut the old filament with pliers.

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/21.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

Note: Pliers are available next to the printers. If not, ask the FabManagers.

## 

Remove the filament from the white tube by gently pulling with the spool, then secure its end to prevent it from unwinding.

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/22.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

Place the new filament on the base at the back of the printer.

:::

:::{}
![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/23.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Place the end of the filament in the white tube and push until it comes out on the other side.

:::
:::

## The printer will extrude for a moment to clean out the previous filament. Check the extrusion; if necessary, restart the process.

# How to Select the File to Print

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/30.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

:::

:::{}

Insert the USB drive containing the G-code file into the printer‚Äôs USB port.

:::
:::

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/31.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

:::

:::{}

From the main menu, select "Print" and navigate to the file saved on the USB drive.

:::
:::

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/32.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

:::

:::{}

IMPORTANT: Before starting the print, select the "Calibrate" option to adjust the bed.

:::
:::

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/33.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

:::

:::{}

Press the "Print" button and confirm your selection.

:::
:::

## The printer will take time to print due to the need to heat the bed.


# How to Monitor the Initial Print:

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/34.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

:::

:::{}

Observe the printing of the first layer:

:::
:::

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

Ensure the filament adheres properly to the print bed.

:::

:::{}

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/35.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## 

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/36.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

If there‚Äôs an issue (poor adhesion, irregular lines, etc.), stop the print to recalibrate or adjust the settings.

# Removing the Model

## 

:::{layout="[40,60]"}
:::{}

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/37.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

:::

:::{}

Once the print is complete, wait for the bed to cool down to avoid damage.

:::
:::

## 

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/38.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

Grab the gray handle of the print bed and apply slight pressure upwards.

## 

![](../images/tuto-1/IMGforge/39.webp){width="95%" fig-align="center"}

While holding the plate by two sides, twist it slightly to detach the print. If necessary, rotate it 90 degrees and repeat on the other sides.
