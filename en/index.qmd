**SheInventor** was created with the purpose of breaking gender barriers in technology, combining art, science, and innovation to empower women with the skills necessary for future jobs. Since I was young, my goal has been to use my design and teaching skills to help people understand the world around us. This project is my contribution to creating an inclusive space with accessible knowledge for all, regardless of stereotypes or limitations we may face.
